qm: using the min structure of best guess diHis NTA-Co with CA and CB constrainted
    * Note that this wasn't the true Co starting position determined from PCS
    * But I wonder, will it move to that position?
    * Strange result because of the non-protonated carbons
qm2: I realized I used NTA without the protons
    * Added the protons, redid constrained min in Avogadro
    * Then ran constrained QM again
