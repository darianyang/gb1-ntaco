For the computational modelling component of the following manuscript:

Title: "Ligand-capped Cobalt(II) Multiplies the Value of the Double-Histidine Motif for PCS NMR Studies"

Author(s): Zhu, Wenkai; Yang, Darian T.; Gronenborn, Angela M.

Includes MD simulations and DFT-based geometry optimizations of GB1-Co2+-NTA, GB1-Co2+-IDA, GB1-Co2+, and CTD-Co2+-NTA. Also DFT of GB1-Zn2+-NTA.

`GB1_Co_NTA.pdb` is the final model of GB1-Co2+-NTA.
