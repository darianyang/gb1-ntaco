Name change in pdb file residue 1 ;
this residue is split into CO and NTA.

/home/dty7/Apps/amber18/bin/teLeap: Note.
1 residues had naming warnings.
Thus, there are split residues;
residue sequence numbers will not correspond to those in the pdb.

  Leap added 2 missing atoms according to residue templates:
       2 H / lone pairs
  The file contained 2 atoms not in residue templates

/home/dty7/Apps/amber18/bin/teLeap: Warning!
Since the number of added atoms equals the number of missing atoms, it is likely
that some atoms had incorrect names; you may want to use addPdbAtomMap to map
these names, or change the names in the PDB file.
